Open question: models of different frameworks and how do we select which one to give to an inference engine?


Inference engines seem pretty clear right now

Need to adapt main bayesbench code to use inference engines

Probably need to do something more with examples. At least a concrete radon example

Add PyMC inference engine, then we'll get better idea of what to do with the models

Write example code for all use cases

Diagnostics need to be added
